title: Watch This! (Dan Friedman's Birthday)
---
Just discovered [this page][danfest] yesterday and couldn't stop watching. The page is about a conference held in celebration of
Dan Friedman's 60th birthday in 2004. Yes it's dated and I am pretty sure lots of people have seen this already
but these talks are awesome! If you haven't, let go of work for some time and watch them.

I particularly liked the one by [Gerald Jay Sussman][sussmantalk] called "The role of programming in the formulation of ideas",
in which he talks about his 2001 book "The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics".

Enjoy!
