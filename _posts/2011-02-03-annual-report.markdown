title: Annual Status Report

I wrote my last article about a year ago and quite
a few things have happened since then. Such an awful lot of things,
in fact, that I won't take pains to describe them all but focus on some
of the more important ones (who's there to read it anyway...).

First of all, I'm now a part-time employee of [Travelping][tp], a
software company in the telecom sector. We're building wifi network equipment
and AAA server solutions in Erlang and it's a real pleasure to work there.
As a first venture into the world of commercial software _product_ development,
I couldn't have hoped to choose better. My coding and software design skills
have improved a lot and my general attitude towards programming has changed in
a positive way. Quite recently, we've taken on [Kanban][limitedwip] as our
development methodology of choice and it's working out very well in terms of productivity.
Getting stuff done feels really nice! Some interesting opportunities
are looming on the horizon as right now, Travelping is entering partnership
with [Erlang Solutions][esl], the primary Erlang consulting and support company.
That partnership will provide even more means to put some of my ideas into action.
Overall, getting employed has been the biggest and most pleasant change in my life
and it's an ongoing challenge that I enjoy facing every single day.

The downside to all this funky, work-related stuff is that I'm sort-of
ditching my computer science studies. I didn't finish a single subject this semester
and as far as I can see, that record isn't going to be improved with the next one.
I'm looking forward to better times, though, as I intend to enroll for a bachelor degree course
in philosophy next winter. That's something I always wanted in a corner of my heart,
so I figure that _now_ might be a better time than never. I'm really looking forward to that
course and the vast quantities of knowledge it teaches. There's gonna be a lot of reading and
writing, for sure, but I think I'm ready to handle that.

Apart from all those _professional_ matters, a fair amount of stuff has been
going on in my personal life as well. A new girlfriend, spiritual experiences,
some acquaintances coming, some fading, it's been a wild ride...
I'm assuming that none of this really interests you unless you know me, in which
case we've probably talked about it anyway. One of the more juicy
details of my private life is that I've grown a beard, a specific part of
which being a [moustache][manenough]. The reason I'm telling you this is that, in my opinion,
moustaches are getting a bad reputation these days for no apparent reason. Mine is barely
visible (it's blonde), yet it's bare existence has sparked countless discussions among
friends and family. Why does this happen? It seems that wearing a moustache (or even a plain beard)
[if you're not at least 40][challenge] is such a wrong thing to do.
Funny enough, I decided to grow a beard only to win a bet, but now it kind of
became part of me, something I strongly wish to keep.

One of my new years' resolutions is to write more, especially on this blog.
I've had some interesting insights on Erlang deployment lately that are waiting
to be published and there's some stuff on Android development I want to share.

Until then, let's get to work!
